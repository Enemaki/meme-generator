## Meme Generator: Mastering React's Core Concepts

Meme Generator is a lighthearted web app built with React to showcase essential concepts like state variables (`useState`), the `useEffect` hook, and conditional rendering. It empowers you to unleash your creativity and generate hilarious memes.

### Learning React's Essentials

This project delves into three foundational React concepts that are vital for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces:

  * State Variables (useState): Utilize `useState` to manage the evolving state of your application. In this case, we'll use it to store the text displayed on the meme images.
  * useEffect Hook: Employ `useEffect` to perform side effects, such as fetching meme templates or updating the DOM based on state changes.
  * Conditional Rendering: Render different UI elements depending on the current state of your application. Here, we'll show or hide elements based on user input.

### Unleash Your Inner Meme Master

Get ready to create side-splitting memes with features like:

  * Popular Meme Templates:** Choose from a variety of hilarious meme templates.
  * Text Input Fields:** Add your funny captions to the top and bottom text areas of the meme template.
  * Generate Button:** Click the button to see your hilarious creation come to life.
  * Dynamic Preview:** Watch your meme update in real-time as you type in the captions.

Note: This project uses placeholder meme templates for demonstration purposes.

### Technologies Used

  * Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript
  * Framework: Vite React ([vitejs.dev](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.google.com/url?sa=E%26source=gmail%26q=https://vitejs.dev/))

### Setting Up Your Meme Lab

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/meme-generator.git
```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
npm install
```

3.  **Run the App:**

<!-- end list -->

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:5173/.

### Understanding the Code

Explore the project code to see how state variables, `useEffect`, and conditional rendering work together:

  * Meme component: Manages state variables for selected meme template and text captions.
  * Input fields: Trigger state updates whenever the user types in the caption areas.
  * Generate button: Renders the meme image with updated captions and conditionally displays it based on state changes.
